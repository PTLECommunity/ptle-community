If you came here looking for a group of people still interested in Pitfall: The Lost Expedition, you came to the right place. On July 12, 2017, we started a Discord server for people interested in speedrunning, glitch hunting, and general disucssion of this game. Five years later and that Discord server has grown to an active community with over 100 members. As a community, we have cut down the game's speedrun time in half, found countless game-breaking glitches, and reunited many Pitfall: The Lost Expedition fans.

This website exists as a central hub for all kinds of information including speedrunning guides, information on the various glitches we've found, and various helpful resources. Want to get involved? Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/CevFbzDBfy) server today!
